One less step when cancelling a Manufacturing Order
===================================================

By default, an MO cannot be cancelled unless the associated picking is also
cancelled.  This module cancels the picking (if it has not been processed) and
the MO in a single step.  All MO related stock moves are cancelled and Stock
levels are as you would expect them to be if the MO never existed.

A detailed description of this module can be found at
