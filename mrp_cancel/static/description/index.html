This module automates the cancellation of a confirmed Manufacturing Order (also called a production order and commonly abbreviated to MO) that has not been picked.

By default, pickings to supply raw materials to production orders are normally transferred (completed) automatically.  This module has no effect when this setting remains as default.

        <div class="oe_span6">
            <p class="oe_mt32">
In cases where users want an intermediate picking process to provide raw materials to production orders (because they subcontract them, or because this is a manual step in their organization, or because someone decides which MO's are picked), they need to make a configuration change.
            </p>
            <p class="oe_mt32">
To do so, they check the option Manage manual picking to fulfill manufacturing orders option, via Settings -> Configuration -> Manufacturing as shown.
 This provides a new option on the Product document to specify products whose raw materials should be picked manually rather than automatically when needed for a production order.
           </p>
            <p class="oe_mt32">
Although this creates an extra step in the Manufacturing process, it also provides more flexibility and potentially models reality better.
