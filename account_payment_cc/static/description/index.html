This module provides a way to record Credit Card purchases, to have the associated AP 
moved from the provider of the product or service to the credit card 
company, and to pay them like you pay a regular Supplier Invoice.

        <h2 class="oe_slogan">Rationale</h2>
        <div class="oe_span12">
            <p class="oe_mt32">
Without this module, if Supplier Invoices are used to record Credit Card purchases, 
the liability (AP) from the Supplier/Vendor must be moved to the Credit Card Company 
via a Manual Journal Entry. 
            </p>
            <p class="oe_mt32">
Because a Journal Entry contains less information than a Supplier Invoice, there may be 
a loss of information that affects book keeping accuracy and the ability to properly 
reconcile the AP amount when the Credit Card statement arrives and needs to be settled. 
            </p>
            <p class="oe_mt32">
This method also requires and additional step not needed when a Supplier Invoice is paid via 
bank or cash.
            </p>
            <p class="oe_mt32">

Without this module, if Manual Journal Entries are used to record Credit Card purchases, 
there may be a loss of information that affects book keeping accuracy and the ability to 
properly reconcile the AP amount when the Credit Card statement arrives and needs to be settled. 
            </p>
            <p class="oe_mt32">

This method also requires a different workflow to the one that is used when a bank or cash payment is made.

        <div class="oe_span12">
            <p class="oe_mt32">
This module automates the creation of the Manual Journal Entry required to move the AP to the Credit Card Company, 
retains all information about the purchase in an Invoice document, and leverages the standard purchase and 
payment workflow already in place for bank and cash payments. 
            </p>
            <p class="oe_mt32">

It supports as many Credit Cards as are needed, configured in the same way an additional payment method would 
be (i.e. via the creation of a new Journal).
            </p>
            <p class="oe_mt32">
To settle a Credit Card statement, the regular workflow to record a Supplier Payment is used allowing the 
removal of charges not included in the statement. Non purchase transactions like fees for annual membership, 
balance transfers, cash advances and foreign transactions; as well as charges for late payments and 
returned checks; can be entered either as Supplier Invoices or Manual Journal Entries as users elect. Both of 
these methods will allow these items to be settled when making a payment to the Credit Card Company.
            </p>
            <p class="oe_mt32">

This module also supports payment cancellation and re-entry (in the case a mistaken amount is entered) as well as refunds (where the purchase is returned and a credit from the Credit Card Company will be issued).            </p>
