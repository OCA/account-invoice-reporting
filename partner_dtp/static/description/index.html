This module provides additional information about the Average Days to Pay for 
both Customer AR and Supplier AP.
</p><p class="oe_mt32">   
Average days to pay = the total number of days to pay divided by the number 
of closed invoices. 
</p><p class="oe_mt32">  
For Example: A Customer had made payments for a total of three invoices: 
<ul><li>Invoice 1 was paid 35 days after the invoice date.</li> 
<li>Invoice 2 was paid 40 days after the invoice date. </li>
<li>Invoice 3 was paid 50 days after the invoice date. </li>
</ul>
</p><p class="oe_mt32">  
Add the total amount of days taken to pay and divide this figure by the number 
of closed invoices - 125/3 - equals 41.67 as the average days to pay.   For a 
Customer on payment terms of 30 Net Days, this indicates they pay nearly 12 
days late on average. 
</p><p class="oe_mt32">  
This same statistic is caluculated for Suppliers – representing the average days 
taken to remit payment to a supplier. 
</p><p class="oe_mt32">  
These statistics are useful when negitating payment terms, credit limits and 
other financial terms between your company and your customers/suppliers.
